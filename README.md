#### Notice
I wrote the html code and css code used in this project myself or used the template. Learn and use code mainly through Googleing.

## What does this project do? 
#### main function
The project analyzes photos based on models that AI has learned when users upload them.
Then, print out and show the most matched major in descending order.

## Why is this project useful? 
#### Basically
it was targeted at students at Handong University. When I ran a simple test on students, people were interested and funny. People were having a hard time at the end of the semester, but I thought it was meaningful to provide a service that allowed people to laugh and rest for a while while using this service.

#### First
 showing that the implementation of the service does not require a lot of coding skills. When I was choosing a project topic, I thought, "I don't know anything, but how can I open a web page and provide a service?"
As I said, I didn't know about html, css, or JS, but I wrote the code for Googleing as the main. As the professor taught us in the OSSL class, we can develop practical services if we properly search for and utilize the actions we want to do.

#### Second
  by imitating popular services, it shows how to implement web services with specific content. If you look at the git commit log, the code is not complicated. For those who have learned a little bit of coding (or almost don't know), it's easy to understand and know what to do with web services without being tied to the level of code.
  
 **I think the first and second information is really helpful for the beginner of the web.**
 
#### Last
  This project is not a one-time project that ends with individual possession of files. You can continue to expand and provide your services by utilizing Web servers.
The implemented service can be provided as a personal server (such as a raspberry pie), and it also has the scalability to put and utilize HTML files using an external server. External servers include Amazon web services, google cloud, cafe24, netlify, etc.

##  How do I get started?
#### 1. Service use
1. Access web service homepage.
2. Upload a photo to be tested.
3. Check the comment and matching ratio for each major printed. 
4. If you want to see and share the results, use the SNS Sharing button provided at the bottom.
5. If you are also curious about the results of other photos (people), delete them and re-use the service.
6. The bottom of the web also embodies the comment function.

#### 2. service imitation
1. Click on the blue letter by Ahn-Ssu.
2. Refer to the code on the connected Github.
3. Write your own html, css, and JS and implement web services.
